# Stock-Analysis
Analyzing apple stock using historical prices

In this repository you will find 3 other files:
  1. Stock_Analyzer.ipynb which is a jupyter notebook containing all the code.
  2. Raw_AAPL_data.csv which is the csv file created from requesting the data from twelvedata's api.
  3. Organized_AAPL_data.csv which has the final organized and cleaned data.

The purpose of this project was to explore apple's price history and look for any trends using the 20 day and 200 day simple moving 
average. I looked at how likely it was for the closing price of apple stock to keep on increasing after
consecutive up or down days. The questions I explored are as follows:
1.	The questions that I explored were:
2.	If a stock's price is above its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), what is the likelihood of the stock increasing in value after X consecutive up days?
3.	If a stock's price is above its 20-day and 200-day SMAs, what is the likelihood of the stock increasing in value after X consecutive up days?
4.	If a stock's price is above its 20-day SMA, what is the likelihood of the stock increasing in value after X consecutive down days?
5.	If a stock's price is above its 20-day and 200-day SMAs, what is the likelihood of the stock increasing in value after X consecutive down days?
6.	If a stock's price is below its 20-day SMA, what is the likelihood of the stock increasing in value after X consecutive down days?
7.	If a stock's price is below its 20-day SMA, what is the likelihood of the stock increasing in value after X consecutive up days?

Overall, I consider the project a success as trends were discovered. This shows that even very basic analysis into the stock market
can return some promising data.
